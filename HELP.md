# HOW TOs :
## Set up VerusBox Monitoring Server

### Note
- VerusBox monitoring service works in combination with the VerusMiner app.
- Each app should be installed in a separate devices to work
- VerusMiner is more stable and optimized than the VerusBox's mining version.
- Monitoring works within your local network
- Monitoring is designed to work in a check-it-when-you-need-it basis so doesn't it have to be up all the time.
- You may use a dedicated phone or table but it's not required
